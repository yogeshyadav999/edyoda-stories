            <h2>Introduction To A Machine Learning Online Course</h2>
            <p><span>EdYoda</span> &nbsp; | 23 Aug 2019</p>
            <p>
              We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of
              its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help
              you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course
              holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning
              is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to
              understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that
              people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of
              computing were all about solving problems using set instructions
              and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data,
              training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus,
              in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for
              computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what
              Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little
              deeper.

              In today’s dynamic world, rapid web application development with a
              smooth user interface that can adapt to specific features is the
              main business requirement. Many organizations around the world
              that intensely depend on programming for their everyday business
              operations, the big business level applications, sites and servers
              have become apparent. It is important to use consistent, scalable
              and standardized software when developing a new application.

            <h2>Impact of Cloud Computing in various industries</h2>
            <p><span>EdYoda</span> &nbsp; | 23 Aug 2019</p>
            <p>
              Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of
              information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of
              global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their
              business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed
              to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud
              computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing
              in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell
              companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security
              enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As
              it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the
              information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house
              computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the
              cloud.

            <h2>Challenges of Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics</h2>
            <p><span>EdYoda</span> &nbsp; | 23 Aug 2019</p>
            <p>
              Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is
              an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data
              promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling
              the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved
              decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract
              value from big data and provide data analytics. Machine learning
              is the ability to learn from data, provide insights, predictions,
              suggestions from data which help in the decision-making process.

            <h2>Breaking the Myths around Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p><span>EdYoda</span> &nbsp; | 23 Aug 2019</p>
            <p>
              As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily,
              cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies
              today. The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after
              adopting every security measure possible by businesses. Cyber
              attackers are developing advancing technologies that are
              continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through
              which a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities,
              user interaction (using malicious links, email attachments) and
              use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.

            <p>
              A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in
              order to bring about a positive change in the work environment.
              One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is
              necessary for every business and especially industries working
              with clouds, networks and computers should conduct a backup of its
              files which will serve as a boon in any point of time.

            <h2>What is Web Scraping?</h2>
            <p><span>EdYoda</span> &nbsp; | 23 Aug 2019</p>
            <p>
              Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to
              gather and analyze information from the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some websites and platforms offer application programming
              interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a
              structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly
              becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular
              platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with
              most of the websites on the internet.

            <p>
              The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long time
              since 1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first introduced
              by Milton Friedman, an American economist, and statistician who
              strongly believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few
              months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among
              college graduates.

            <h2>Practical Machine Learning with Python and Keras</h2>
            <p><span>EdYoda</span> &nbsp; | 23 Aug 2019</p>
            <p>
              Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses
              statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to
              “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific
              task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how
              efficiently (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good
              text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google
              Home.

          We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its
          subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get
          a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin
          with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a
          concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a
          data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize.
          While traditional forms of computing were all about solving.

          Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of
          information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global
          enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business.
          Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its
          infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs
          to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key

          Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an
          important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data
          promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the
          process of optimization, discovering insights and improved decision
          making. This potential relies on the ability to extract value from big
          data and provide data analytics. Machine learning is the ability to
          learn from data, provide insights, predictions, suggestions from data
          which help in the decision-making process.

          Cybersecurity plays an integral role in the process of good business
          models. But even cybersecurity programs built with good intentions can
          fall short in front of advanced cyber attacking programs. There are
          some vulnerabilities that you are not aware of. Most of the
          organizations believe in cybersecurity myths that are the major reason
          for growing threats and attacks. There are many methods through which
          a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities, user
          interaction (using malicious links, email attachments) and use of
          stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.

          A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order
          to bring about a positive change in the work environment. One of the
          main precautions or a contingency plan that is necessary for every
          business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and
          computers should conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a
          boon in any point of time. Backup is the process of creating and
          storing copies of data that is confidential to the organization
          against the data loss or in case of emergency.

          Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather
          and analyze information from the Internet. Some websites and platforms
          offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to
          access information in a structured way, but others might not. While
          APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with
          today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when
          interacting with most of the websites on the internet.Rather than
          reading data from standard API responses, we’ll need to find the data
          ourselves by reading the website’s pages and feeds.

          The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long time since
          1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first introduced by Milton
          Friedman, an American economist, and statistician who strongly
          believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few months, there
          has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among college
          graduates. So, what is this Income Share Agreement? As defined in
          Wikipedia: “An income share agreement (or ISA) is a financial
          structure in which an individual or organization provides something of

          Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses
          statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn”
          (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from
          data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how efficiently
          (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good text-to-speech has
          become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google Home. Some of the
          tasks that can be solved by implementing Machine Learning include:
